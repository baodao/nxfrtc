Create a `dev_config.json` file in the same folder as the main entry point (usually project root)\n3. Just require getconfig like so from anywhere in your project:\n\n```js\nvar config = require('getconfig');\n\n```\n4. that's it!\n\n\n## Where to put your config and what to call it\n\nAgain, getconfig looks for a config file in the same folder as the main entry point of your app. In most cases, that's the root of your project.\n\nJust name it so that it matches the following pattern: `{{ environment name }}_config.json`.\n\nIf `NODE_ENV` isn't set it defaults to `dev`.\n\nYou can set name your environments whatever you want, but we color these nicely:\n\n- `dev` - dev_config.json\n- `test` - test_config.json\n- `production` - production_config.json\n\n\n## Comments in JSON, oh my!\n\ngetconfig uses [ALCE](https://github.com/walmartlabs/ALCE) to parse JSON files, which means you can use comments, single quotes, and unquoted keys, woohoo! But of course it works just fine on regular JSON too. It just gives you the option.\n\n\n## Explicitly setting the config location\n\nIn certain circumstances, when your app isn't run directly (e.g. test runners) getconfig may not be able to lookup your config file properly. In this case, you can set a `GETCONFIG_ROOT` environment variable to directory where your configs are held.\n\n\n## Other options, info\n\nYou can also tell getconfig whether you want it to log out it's environment info (as it does by default) and whether or not to use colors in output. By adding the following to your `{{some name}}_config.json` file:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"getconfig\": {\n        \"colors\": false, //turns off colors\n    }\n}\n```\n\n```json\n{\n    \"getconfig\": {\n        \"silent\": true, //turns off all output\n    }\n}\n```\n\ngetconfig will always fill in the `getconfig.env` value in your resulting config object with the current environment name so you can programatically determine the environment if you'd like.\n\n\n## Changelog\n\n0.3.0 - Switching from JSON.parse to ALCE to allow single quotes and comments. Better readme.\n\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n\nif you dig it follow [@HenrikJoreteg](http://twitter.com/henrikjoreteg) on twitter.\n",
